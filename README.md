**Modifications only need to be made in routing.py, unless specified.**

The paths can be modified in line 305 / 308 if they are not working correctly.

In order to switch the infile, modify line 308 to a valid infile.

If you wish to view the Lee Moore version of the algorithm, set line 311 to True. If you wish to see the A* implementation, 
set it to false. 

The graphics will remain onscreen for 20s after completing. After routing is complete, the number of successfully routed
wire should appear in the window in the lower lefthand corner.

To slow down the routing speed for A*, modify line 313 of A_Star.py. For Lee_moore, modify line 155.
